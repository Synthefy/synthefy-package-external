    "There are two ways to use FM Eval Bench.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To forecast on datasets that have already been added to FM Eval Bench, you can directly interact with `synthefy-package/src/synthefy_pkg/fm_evals/eval.py.` use the --help flag to see supported datasets, models, and how to configure a run from the command line. To add your own datasets and forecasting models there, see [FM Evals Documentation](https://www.notion.so/FM-Evals-Documentation-229a80f2cd7c80afa9d5dcafffde916e?source=copy_link) for instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You can use FM Eval Bench's forecasting model API to run inference with any supported forecasting model on your own data, external to the Eval Bench tooling.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the latter."
